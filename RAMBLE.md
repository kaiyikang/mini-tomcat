To be honest, I haven't acquired the kind of knowledge I initially envisioned through this process â€“ that is, a flexible mastery of Java's fundamental and related libraries. However, I have certainly gained some impressions, which manifest as functional blocks, or perhaps code blocks.

I now understand which blocks can fulfill specific needs or functionalities, and grasp their basic working principles. Whenever I begin to conceptualize solutions at a modular level, I can simplify particular details and know how to locate the necessary components. This, in itself, has been a valuable form of learning.

The immediate next step is clear and certain, but the path beyond remains shrouded in uncertainly, a prospect that can feel daunting. We naturally worry about the unforeseen consequences, the ripple effects of combining multiple unknowns. However, this anxiety is often an illusion. Focus on executing it, and then, and only then, address the step that follows. Remember, as human, we posses an extraordinary capacity to adapt and thrive, even amidst chaos.

The thinking about how to cover different areas in the test:

Part One: Happy Path - Can it do the right thing?

- The simplest case
- The common Case
- The special feature case
- The data transformation case

Part Two: Negative & Boundary Cases - Would it crash if an exception occurred?

- Boundary Values
  - Null
  - ""
  - boundary
- Malformed/Invalid Input
  - structural deficiency
  - structural redundancy
  - Illegal content
- Exception Handling

Part three: Environment & Dependency Cases - Is the behavior influenced by the environment?
Note: it usually be in Integration Test

- Parameterization/Configuration
  - toggle
- Mocking Dependencies

The best way to tackle a task you dislike is not to rush through it, but to trade intensity for consistency. Instead of seeing it as a huge, annoying obstacle, break it down into small, manageable sessions over a longer period. By slowing down the pace and applying focused, patient effort, even the most dreaded tasks become achievable.
